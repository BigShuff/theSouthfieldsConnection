        <p class ="txtFormat">Hi my name is Steve my wife and I have been living in Southfields since August 2000. I am a
            Website Engineer (semi retired). I developed this website in the hope that you the people of the community
            may find it a benefit in the following ways.</p>
        <ul class ="txtFormat">
            <li>By holding safe public walks and coffee mornings etc, ensuring that everyone in the community has events
                where they can find and talk to others.</li>
            <li>Supplying a local for sale and wanted section. Enabling us to give new life to items that would
                otherwise end up unwanted or thrown away.</li>
            <li>Handy community information at your fingertips.</li>
            <li>A regular crossword along with readers recipies, and interesting stories for your free time.</li>
            <li>Local business advertising helping us to find someone local to help us with those jobs we cant do ourselves.
            </li>
        </ul>
